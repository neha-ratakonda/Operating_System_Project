## The Roller Coaster problem
Problem Statement: Design and implement a multithreaded simulation of an amusement park roller coaster ride. The roller coaster has a limited capacity for passengers and can only operate for a specific number of rides before taking a break. The simulation includes the roller coaster thread and multiple passenger threads. 
 
Constraints: 

 * The roller coaster has a fixed capacity  for passengers on each ride. 
 * The roller coaster can go on a maximum number of rides before taking a break. 
 * Proper usage and handling of semaphores are crucial for correct simulation behaviour. 
 * Proper counting and tracking of passengers are essential. 
 * Proper thread management, joining, and synchronization are necessary for a realistic and error-free simulation. 
 * Proper acquisition and release of semaphores ensure thread safety, preventing race conditions and ensuring correct shared resource access.
